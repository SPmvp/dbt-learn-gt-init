# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the jaffle_shop project
# as tables. These settings can be overridden in the individual model files
# using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

  # Optional overrides — if omitted, billing_period macros default to:

  # Example: dbt run --vars '{billing_start_date: 2025-01-01, billing_end_date: 2026-01-01}'
